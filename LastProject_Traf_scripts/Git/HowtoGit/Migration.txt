Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch : 
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

Push the branch on github : 
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.

You can see all branches created by using :
